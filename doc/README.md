# Install `ledger-mode` info files

Run `make` to install `ledger-mode` info pages in `.`.

I do this manually as I want direct access to info while not installing
`ledger-mode` from melpa (as I want to use my folding feature). The
`transaction-folding-info-install` branch should be deleted when/if the
`transaction-folding` branch is merged.

FIXME: Maybe there is a better way to do this in elisp.
